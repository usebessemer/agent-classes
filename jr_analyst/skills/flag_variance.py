"""`flag_variance` — the per-pair watchdog: surface material actual-vs-budget gaps.

The slice-2 jr-analyst skill, downstream of `ingest_and_align`. Where that skill
*aligns* a window's certainty-graded actuals to budget 1:1, this one *reads the
aligned pairs* and computes, for each, the signed actual-vs-budget delta —
surfacing the ones that clear the materiality floor for a human's planning
review. It is the analyst's counterpart to the Bookkeeper's `flag_anomaly`: the
lowest-risk skill on the read-only core — it **proposes, never acts**.

The read-only §5-style boundary, preserved exactly (charter §1):

- **Reader-only / proposes-not-writes.** `flag_variance` *returns* a
  `VarianceReport`. It takes an already-computed `AlignedDataset` and a config —
  **no source, no sink, no writer, no port** in its signature — so it structurally
  *cannot* read a system, mutate, or publish. It is pure and **sync**: a skill is
  async iff it drives a port, and this one drives none. It mutates neither input,
  never resolves / suppresses / acts on a variance, and never blocks a downstream
  skill — a flag is a note for a human, not a gate.
- **Every flag is traceable + graded.** Each `VarianceFlag` links back to both
  sides via their `source_ref`s and carries the aligned pair's certainty grade
  **verbatim** (`pair.certainty`, i.e. the actual's grade) — a `realized_open`
  variance is surfaced graded open, never flattened. Traceability, not
  "never wrong", is the trust wedge (charter §1).

🚧 **THE LINE — §2, non-forecasting (the boundary most likely to bloat).**
`flag_variance` reports the variance that **already exists** between a realized
actual and its budget — a *snapshot*, decided from the two aligned amounts and
nothing else. It is **forward-looking, not a forecast**: it grades how settled the
figure is (via the pair's ladder certainty), it never predicts tomorrow's. There
is deliberately **no trend, no run-rate, no projection, no EAC (estimate-at-
completion), no percent-complete, no scenario or predictive modelling, and no
"this pair is trending over budget"** — that inferential CFO overlay is excluded
by charter §2 (the parked forecasting rung). Concretely, the line shows up as
three pins:

1. A `realized_open` pair is reported at **actuals-to-date** — its signed delta,
   with **no projected final number** grafted on. Open means in-flight, not
   forecast-to-completion.
2. `budget.amount` is the subtrahend **verbatim** (a referent-provenance pin): it
   is never prorated, percent-complete-adjusted, or run-rated to "what the budget
   should be by now". The plan figure is used exactly as the budget source gave
   it.
3. The forward-looking ladder rungs a later slice carries (`committed`,
   `anticipated`) are **never read** here — this skill sees the two realized rungs
   an `AlignedPair` already holds, nothing it would have to model.

The delta is a signed **exact `Decimal`** (`actual.amount - budget.amount`),
never `abs`-stored and never `float`, mirroring `ReconciliationGap.delta`: the
sign *is* the over/under classification, and an exact difference is a real
variance, never a float-rounding artifact. There is deliberately **no ratio and
no percent** — a variance is a signed money delta, not a computed rate.

**The materiality floor, inverted-when-unset (charter §3/§5.4).** `config.
variance_floor` is the one surfacing knob: a variance is surfaced when
`abs(delta)` is **strictly over** it. Unset (`None`) the default is *inverted*
from the Bookkeeper's over-materiality check — where an unset floor there *skips*
the check, here an unset floor surfaces **every** non-zero-delta pair (none
suppressed): for a read-only analyst "inert" means *show everything*, never
*hide everything*. A zero delta is never surfaced (there is no variance to flag),
and a delta exactly equal to the floor is suppressed (the comparison is strict
`>`). A **non-finite** floor is inert for the same fail-safe reason: the config
layer coerces the floor with `Decimal(str(...))` and passes `Infinity` / `NaN`
through verbatim, so the comparison guards `floor.is_finite()` — an `Infinity`
floor would otherwise silently suppress *every* variance (a watchdog gone dark,
undetectable to a human reading a clean report) and a `NaN` floor would raise on
the first real variance. A floor the analyst cannot meaningfully compare against
surfaces everything; it never hides.
